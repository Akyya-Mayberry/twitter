# Project 4 - *Twitter Redux*

Time spent: **17** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] Hamburger menu
   - [X] Dragging anywhere in the view should reveal the menu.
   - [X] The menu should include links to your profile, the home timeline, and the mentions view.
   - [X] The menu can look similar to the example or feel free to take liberty with the UI.
- [ ] Profile page
   - [X] Contains the user header view
   - [X] Contains a section with the users basic stats: # tweets, # following, # followers
- [X] Home Timeline
   - [X] Tapping on a user image should bring up that user's profile page

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Profile Page
   - [ ] Implement the paging view for the user description.
   - [ ] As the paging view moves, increase the opacity of the background screen. See the actual Twitter app for this effect
   - [ ] Pulling down the profile page should blur and resize the header image.
- [ ] Account switching
   - [ ] Long press on tab bar to bring up Account view with animation
   - [ ] Tap account to switch to
   - [ ] Include a plus button to Add an Account
   - [ ] Swipe to delete an account


The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
If I was a first time user of the app and new to smartphones, I would have no idea that I can pan to see a side menu. I would update UI to include some sort of indicator. 
Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

  1.I may find out these two question on my own before class, but just in case, why use regular views instead of container views from the object library?
  2. When the screen is rotated while I am displaying my hamburger menu, why does my main container view disappear off screen?


## Video Walkthrough

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
The videos provided and the class assignments were extremely helpful getting through this assignment. It was fun. the only challenge was that we formed groups and had our first assignment. The group project is exciting so it was hard to balance time between that and this assignment.
